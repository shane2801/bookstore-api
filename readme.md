# 📚 Bookstore API

A RESTful Bookstore API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL using a clean layered architecture.  
This project is designed to simulate a real-world backend system with scalable structure, separation of concerns, and proper data modeling.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 📦 Products
- Create, read, update, and delete books
- Stored in a PostgreSQL database
- Input validation for safe data handling

### 🛒 Orders
- Create and manage orders linked to products
- Relational database structure (orders ↔ products)
- Supports partial updates (PATCH)
- DELETE orders

### 🔍 Data Enrichment
- Orders return full product details (not just IDs)
- JOIN queries for easier debugging and frontend integration

## 🧱 Architecture

This project follows a **layered architecture pattern**:

Client → Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories → Database

### 🔹 Routes
Define API endpoints and map them to controllers.

### 🔹 Controllers
Handle HTTP requests and responses.

### 🔹 Services
Contain business logic and validation rules.

### 🔹 Repositories
Handle direct database queries (PostgreSQL).

### 🔹 Database
Stores products and orders with relational structure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- pg (node-postgres)
- Zod (validation)
- Nodemon (development)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-api.git
cd bookstore-api

```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create PostgreSQL database

```bash
CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
4. Create tables
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
### 5. Configure environment variables

Create a .env file:
```bash
DB_USER=your_user
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=bookstore
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_PORT=5432

PORT=3000
```
### 6. Run the server
```bash
npm start
```
Server runs on:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
